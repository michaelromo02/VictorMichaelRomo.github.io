							<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/Airbnb-rebrand-by-DesignStudio_dezeen_468_8.webp" alt="" /></span>Our primary data source for this analysis is the Seattle Airbnb dataset, a rich collection of listings across the city's diverse neighborhoods. To perform this analysis, we harnessed the capabilities of Tableau to join relevant tables and visualize the data. By integrating Tableau, we ensured that the analysis was both comprehensive and visually accessible.</p>
							<h3>Average Price by Zip Code</h3>
							<p>One of the primary objectives of our analysis was to explore the variation in listing prices across different neighborhoods, achieved through the amalgamation of data from multiple tables within Tableau. The results were then visualized using Tableau's intuitive tools, providing clear insights into pricing disparities between Seattle's zip codes. This information proves invaluable to potential travelers and hosts in their decision-making processes.</p>
							<h3>Average Price by Bedroom Numbers</h3>
							<p>Tableau facilitated the seamless integration of data related to bedroom numbers, allowing us to calculate and visualize the average price for listings with different numbers of bedrooms. The visualizations produced clear correlations between bedroom numbers and pricing, empowering travelers to make tailored accommodation choices and hosts to develop competitive pricing strategies.</p>

							<h3>Monthly Revenue Trends</h3>
							<p>In examining yearly revenue trends, we used Tableau to calculate monthly revenue for diverse listings, presenting this information graphically. This allowed us to identify seasonal fluctuations and revenue trends. By harnessing Tableau's data visualization capabilities, we provided a clear view of how revenue changes throughout the year. This information is instrumental for hosts in optimizing pricing strategies and for travelers planning their trips to Seattle.</p>
							<h3>Conclusion</h3>
							<p>In conclusion, this report has provided a comprehensive analysis of Seattle Airbnb pricing, bedroom numbers, and yearly revenue, segmented by zip codes and monthly trends. The utilization of Tableau not only facilitated the integration and visualization of complex data but also enhanced the accessibility of our findings. It underscores the importance of location, bedroom numbers, and seasonality in pricing dynamics. For hosts, this information is invaluable for setting competitive prices and maximizing revenue, while travelers can make well-informed decisions when booking accommodations in Seattle. This report offers a holistic view of Seattle's dynamic Airbnb market, empowered by the data integration and visualization capabilities of Tableau.</p>
